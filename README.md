## About

A small portfolio site created to serve as my business card in the IT world. It showcases my favourite projects and tells the visitor a little bit more about myself - not only my current technical skills, but also who am I as a person. I used Figma and Gimp to work on the design, learning much in the process. The page is hosted on Netlify using the current build from GitHub.

#### Main features

* hero section with a video background inside a picture to create an illusion of a working monitor screen. The monitor can be "turned off" and back "on" via a toggle.
* projects section
* contact form with html validation + additional honeypot field for spam prevention (on top of what Netlify already employs as a default)
* available in English and Polish - full translation at the click of a button
* responsive
* animations using animate-on-scroll + some simple custom ones
